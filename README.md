# Ivan Yip â€” Portfolio

## About

This is my personal portfolio â€” a space to showcase case studies, experiments, and unhinged thoughts about creative and operational work.  
I'm Ivan Yip, a digital strategist who works at the intersection of web development, marketing automation, and design systems. I specialize in building no-nonsense systems for startups and SaaS brands â€” from conversion funnels and CRM flows to brand launches and media content.
